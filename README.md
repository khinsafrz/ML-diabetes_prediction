Machine learning project - diabetes prediction

Diabetes is a dangerous disease that can cause long-term complications, early diagnosis is important to prevent diabetes and its related health issues.
This study aims to develop a prediction model to diagnose diabetes using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-nearest Neighbour (KNN).
The project is done with R programming language.
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, an open-source platform. It has 70,692 rows and 18 columns.
The maximum accuracy of 74.7% was achieved using SVM with a cost of 0.1.
